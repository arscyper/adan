              To expedite the check-in process, we will begin on-site registration on
              Tuesday, June 24th. Make sure to bring your photo ID, as we’ll need to
              verify it prior to assigning you your Google I/O badge. We’re OK with
              government issued licenses, passports, and other forms of identification.
              If you do not have proper identification, you won’t be able to receive a
              badge and will not be admitted into the conference. If you’re an Academic
              attendee, please remember to bring proof of eligibility.

              We're making some changes to this year's registration process. The window to submit a registration application will open at 4:00pm PDT on April 15th and stay open until 2:00pm PDT on April 18th, so you’ll have plenty of time to apply. We'll randomly select applicants after the window closes on the 18th and notify those selected with their ticket purchase confirmations via email. Qualified registration applicants will be selected at random for ticket assignments. The order in which registration applications are received has no bearing on the final outcome.

                  You will then complete the required registration fields and continue on to authorize the purchase of your ticket via Google Wallet. At this time, Google Wallet will not complete the charge, but a pre-authorization will be placed to ensure the funds are&nbsp;available.

Please be sure to bring a current school ID or other proof that you are qualified to receive this special rate when you check in at the&nbsp;conference.

If you are not sure whether the professional guidelines for your school, university, organization, or agency would allow you to accept these items, please check with your local ethics officer before the event.
